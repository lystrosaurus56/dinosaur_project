# dinosaur_project

For my final Codecademy data analysis project, I wanted to work with data about dinosaurs. In this project, I used data from the 2020 publication Ten more years of discovery: revisiting the quality of the sauropodomorph dinosaur fossil record available on [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061%2Fdryad.6hdr7sqxb).

This dataset collects information regarding 305 individual species of sauropodomorphs (long-necked dinosaurs and their relatives), including geographic location, size, and age of fossil. The information comes from 1144 individual specimens, and the paper is mainly looking at how complete each fossil is.

There are two Python files in this project: one where I do the majority of the data cleaning, and one where I finish the data cleaning and perform data analysis.
